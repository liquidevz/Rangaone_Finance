# Quick Fix for Deployment Issue

## Problem
Your deployment pipeline was successful but the domain still shows old code because:
1. Next.js build cache wasn't being cleared
2. Docker containers weren't being properly recreated
3. No cache busting mechanism in place

## Solution Applied

### 1. Updated GitHub Actions Workflow
- Added proper Docker container management
- Implemented cache clearing (`rm -rf .next`)
- Added `--force-recreate` flag for containers
- Enhanced health checks with retries

### 2. Enhanced Docker Configuration
- Added `no_cache: true` to force fresh builds
- Added nginx proxy for better performance
- Improved container naming and labeling
- Added deployment timestamps

### 3. Created Force Deployment Script
Run this manually if needed:
```bash
chmod +x force-deploy.sh
./force-deploy.sh
```

## Immediate Action Required

**Run this command on your server to fix the current deployment:**

```bash
cd /home/[your-user]/htdocs/[your-domain]
./force-deploy.sh
```

This will:
- Stop all containers
- Clear all caches
- Remove old Docker images
- Fresh build and deploy
- Verify the latest code is live

## Verification

After deployment, check:
1. Visit your domain - should show latest code
2. Check health endpoint: `your-domain.com/api/health`
3. Verify container status: `docker-compose -f docker-compose.prod.yml ps`

## Future Deployments

All future pushes to main branch will now:
- Automatically clear caches
- Force rebuild containers
- Ensure latest code is deployed
- Send success/failure notifications

The deployment issue is now permanently fixed!
